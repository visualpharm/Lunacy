# Welcome to icons  services user manual
This document covers pretty much everything you need to know about how to get started and succeed with icons services.
# Why icons services?

The demand for visual content seems is only getting stronger nowadays. More views, more downloads, more profit are associated with visually rich posts, apps and all sort of UX in general. This trend poses a new challenge for developers and UX designers: how to efficiently manage the basic pieces of visual content in their projects? Having just a huge bunch of icons files may not necessarily help one to efficiently and competitively develop and support visually rich applications. Wouldn't it be much more better to have a dedicated reliable platform like the [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) that would cope with all sort of the challenges associated with managing icons, keeping them up-to-date, and making them easily accessible in the most suitable forms and various contexts?

# Which framework do I need?

Conceptually, the [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) provides two frameworks or in other words two distinct ways of how icons could be accessed and utilized. These two pathways are known as <b>['standard'](#standard-framework) and ['service integration'](#service-integration-framework) frameworks</b>. Each framework is associated with certain set of tools which are discussed below in detail. 

One of the most frequently asked questions from our customers is "<b>what license do I need</b>", meaning <b>which framework am I supposed to use</b> to achieve the goals of my project. The rest of this document is purposely dedicated to give you a clear answer for that question and to master the essentials of the frameworks. 


## Service Integration Framework
In a short, service integration gives you an ability to access icons programmatically, from within your apps, on the fly in real-time. This opens huge opportunities to your clients. With the use of service integration, end-users of your products could generate their own projects, build their own visual content from within your apps tied to our service. The framework consist of:

 <!--## Overview-->
The big idea behind the icons API is the ease of manipulation with visual content. Having just a huge bunch of icons files may not necessarily help you to efficiently and competitively produce and support agile development. Wouldn't it be much more better to have a dedicated platform like [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) that would cope with all sort of the challenges associated with managing, updating, and delivering the visual content in most suitable forms to outperform expectations of even the most demanding developers and UX designers? That is actually what the icons/photos services are all about. 

This is us, the Icons8, who takes the responsibility to maintain the whole [infrastructure](https://api.icons8.com/) of managing and accessing visual content to let our clients to focus on delivering new products to the market with highest pace and lowest cost possible.

In a nutshell, [icons API](https://api.icons8.com/) represents by itself a web service with a list of web methods to manipulate with the visual content on the fly. The web methods could be invoked from various types of applications either web, desktop, or mobile. This is how integration is being achieved. Such architecture gives a unique level of flexibility to our clients to develop very sophisticated applications with outstanding UX and optimised time-to-market.







## Elements, Attributes, Parameters

## API vs. JSON (pros&cons)
### What If We Go out of Business etc.
## Examples

## Use cases
These are examples of API usage in production applications:

-   **Template customisation.**  <br> This is how  [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) uses our API to customise layouts.
    
-   **Graphics and text editors.** <br>  [Gravit](https://gravit.io/)  allows to insert our icons via API into their mockups.
    
-   **Application customisation.** <br>  [TimeTune](http://timetune.center/)  uses our API to customise activities.


 

## API or JSON?

**We think  [API](https://api.icons8.com/)  is better.**  It took us a couple of years to develop it. In particular, it provides:

-   Sphinx full-text  [search](https://icons8.com/icon/131/search)  with morphology
-   A third party spell  [check](https://icons8.com/icon/set/check/all)  API
-   Multiple operations that would take months of development
-   Also, we’ve learned some stuff the hard way, by doing it and removing it. For example, using synonyms APIs proved to be a failure
-   Also, we keep improving the metadata daily

On the other hand,  **utilizing JSON on your side is 100% reliable;**  you can’t beat that.

## What If We Go out of Business?

If we want you to count on our technology, we must earn your trust. Here is what happens  _in an extremely unlikely event of an emergency_, as they say in the pre-flight safety demonstrations.

If we go out of  [business](https://icons8.com/web-app/category/Business), the following will happen:

-   **We’ll keep the website**, including our API,  [running](https://en.icons8.com/web-app/915/running)  for years. Although we utilize a number of servers for everything from generating the icons to serving content to Google, the core of the website is an $80 droplet on Digital Ocean. We must be extremely broke to shut it down.
-   **If you’ve used JSON, you are 100% safe.**  If you use our API, keep our JSON export as a backup; if anything happens, you’ll have years to switch to it.

However, the probability of going out of  [business](https://icons8.com/icon/pack/business)  is low. Our company,  [VisualPharm](http://visualpharm.com/), has existed since 2003; the cash flow is good, and we grow organically without any loans.

## License Expiration

A license is valid for one year after the purchase. It includes:

-   All icons created to the date + one year of new icons
-   Access to our API (according to your plan)
-   Support (according to your plan)

After one year, we will offer you a subscription for another year.

_Exception_: we will not charge for the software that you don’t support anymore. You can keep distributing the software for free, if:

-   It has all icons offline and doesn’t use our API
-   You don’t release new versions after the license expiration

## Limitations

-   The price includes  _all icons at the moment of the purchase + 1 year of new icons_. The icons that we create after 1 year cost $249 per year.
-   Please make it clear to your users that they can only use the icons for creations with your software. They cannot export the icons and use them in other authoring tools.
-   Please make it clear to your users that they can purchase additional licenses.
- 
## Getting Started

To get started, please  [contact us](https://icons8.com/contact)  to obtain an API key.

## Pricing

Our API license starts at $100/month.

   <strong>Icons Retrieval Service (Omg-Img)</strong>
  </summary>

<br>
**1. Why [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service?**
The service empowers developers and interface designers to get new UI products to the market faster at a lower cost. It drastically increases the workflow efficiency and let your team to stay focused on business logic of your app not on the low level processing tasks such as adjusting icons sizes, colors, formats etc. You even don’t have to export an icon and store it on a server. Everything becomes much more easier with [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service. For example, it takes just a line of code `<img src=’https://img.icons8.com/search’/>` to insert a png icon [Magnifier](https://icons8.com/icon/set/magnifier/all) directly from the CDN to your application of any scale.

**2. Icon’s search available straight from the address bar of your browser.**
For your convenience, [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service architecture allows developers and designers to browse for new icons directly from browser’s address bar as following: 

 - https://img.icons8.com/home 
 - https://img.icons8.com/house
- https://img.icons8.com/bungalow
- https://img.icons8.com/targaryen-house

There is always an option to browse for more icons from our web site search engine UI  https://icons8.com/icon/new-icons/all to get the names that you may use in constructing appropriate icons links for your apps.

**3. How do I apply styles?**
On our website, there is a list of icons styles on the left pane of the icons page. The list contains more than 20 various styles to outperform expectations of even the most demanding end-users of your apps. Below is the list of the most popular styles:

|monochrome|coloured|
|----------|--------|
|iOS: http://img.icons8.com/ios/car|Color: http://img.icons8.com/color/car|
|Windows: http://img.icons8.com/windows/car|Office: http://img.icons8.com/office/car|
|Material: http://img.icons8.com/material/car|Dusk: http://img.icons8.com/dusk/car|

[Omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) let you apply a new style as easy as just inserting a style code within an icon’s link.

**4. Recolouring monochrome icons made easy**
To change the color of an icon with [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service you simply insert an appropriate color code within an icon’s link as it is demonstrated below:
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/ios/FF0000/car'> `http://img.icons8.com/ios/FF0000/car`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/ios/00FF00/car'> `http://img.icons8.com/ios/00FF00/car`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/ios/0000FF/car'> `http://img.icons8.com/ios/0000FF/car`

**5. How can I resize an icon?**
To modify an icon’s size the same logic is applied as before. It’s just enough to insert an icon’s size within its link:
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/30px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/30px/car' />
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/40px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/40px/car' />
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/50px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/50px/car' /> 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/60px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/60px/car' /> 

For your convenience, the size of an icon can be written in two different formats: `100x100` or `100px`, depending on what you prefer the most.

**6. How can all sorts of artefacts be minimised when using pixel perfect?**
Each icon style is drawn for a specific pixel grid. Look at these few examples of various pixel grids: 
* iOS: `50x50`
* Metro: `26x26`
* Windows: `32x32`
* Material: `24x24`
* Color: `48x48`
* Office: `16x16`, `30x30`, `40x40`, `80x80`

In order to avoid all sorts of artefacts (blurring edges, washed out colours etc.) associated with changing an icon’s size, we strongly recommend you to choose multiples of original icon's size. For example for iOS style the multiples would be: `50x50`, `100x100`, `150x150` etc.
You can set an icon’s size either by specifying the size in pixels `100x100` / `100px` or with the use of factors: `2x` or `x2` (the number can vary).
For example:
- 'https://img.icons8.com/color/1x/brazilian-carnival.png' <img src='https://img.icons8.com/color/1x/brazilian-carnival.png'/>
- 'https://img.icons8.com/color/2x/brazilian-carnival.png' <img src='https://img.icons8.com/color/2x/brazilian-carnival.png' />

**7. What is the maximum size of an icon that your service can provide?**
The restriction applied to free png icons is 550px. Please read more in [API license](https://icons8.com/paid-license-99/#/).

**8. Which license do I need to start using [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/)?**
To start using [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com) service for free, just [set a link](https://icons8.com/license) or buy [paid licence](https://icons8.com/paid-license-99/#/).

**9. What should I do if I can not find an icon that I need?**
You may send us a [request](https://icons8.com/request-icon/) to draw any icon you actually  need. It’s completely free. We try to do our the best to make our service comprehensive. However we do prioritise the requests which have the highest demand. You even may ask your friends, relatives and any community members to vote for your requested icon in order put your request on the very top of the queue. 

**10. Can an icon used in my app change over time?**
In short, it’s very unlikely but possible. The most updated version of an icon is accessible by a given icon’s link.
E.G. currently for the following link **`https://img.icons8.com/water-molecule`** we keep showing an icon with illustration of a water drop or an abstract molecule. However if we begin to receive more and more requests to change the icon’s appearance to say a water molecule like this H<sub>2</sub>O, then most probably we will alternate its look somehow to represent the structure of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen bonded together. 

In case if you are planning to use an icon longterm, the best solution would be to use the canonical full path to the icon (.png), which can be formed [here](https://icons8.com/).

**11. Can I use an icon with .png extension?**
Yes you can use icons with .png extension in [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service, however you would need to know the exact name of a .png icon. The .png names could differ from the names provided by the service. In order to find the desired .png icon name and create an appropriate query for it, you may use searching engine UI available on our website [here](https://icons8.com/icon/new-icons/all).

**12. How to use responsive size for [Office](https://icons8.com/office-icons/) style?**
It’s quite simple. Just add a parameter `office` to your request. For example:
 - <img src='http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=16'> `http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=16`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=30'> `http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=30`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=40'> `http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=40`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=80'> `http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=80`

   <strong>What are the end points for icons Searching/Retrieval? Give me few examples, please!</strong>
 </summary>
  
 The endpoint for searching requests is: https://search.icons8.com/api/iconsets/v4/search for retrieval: http://img.icons8.com In order to serch / retrieve an icon you embed your API key just right into the requests: https://search.icons8.com/api/iconsets/v4/search?term=home&amount=50&offset=0&platform=all&language=en-US&token= "YOUR API KEY" http://img.icons8.com/ios/F0AC34/search.svg?token= "YOUR API KEY" You may change the order of parameters in you request accodring to the documantation. Notice that you can filter results with style/platform and then group the results with the use of categories. Basically when you supply a search query to our v4 service you get back a json which contains all the metadata of the most relevant icons associated with that query. Then you may use this category info contained in the metadata to actually group the results according to categories.

  <summary>
   <strong>Why icon size is not icluded in metadata returned by Search Engine? Why Pixel Perfect?</strong>
 </summary>
  
Notice, the icons that we have are of a vector format and that is why they could be of any size. By this reason we do not include the icon's size in metadata. I.e. you can substitute any size in the request of a retrieval serivce and receive the corresponding png icon in the requested size. For icons retrieval we use [Omg-Img](...) service. To retrieve an icon you embed your API key just right into your request http://img.icons8.com/ios/F0AC34/search.svg?token= "YOUR API KEY" You may change the order of parameters in your request. Also keep in mind that due to the conversion of svg into png the "pixel perfect" come into play. To eliminate the artefacts of format conversion (from vector to raster) there is an appropriate size for each platform which you can then multiply by various factors 1x, 2x, 3x etc. to get the png size you need.
