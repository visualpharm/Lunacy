# Welcome to icons/photos  services user manual
This documentation covers pretty much everything you need to know about how to get started and succeed with icons/photos services.
# Overview
The demand for visual content seems is only getting stronger nowadays. More views, more reposts, more downloads, more profit are associated with visually rich posts, docs, websites, apps and all sort of UX in general. This demand drives the delivery of more and more visual content to the market and consequently pose a new challenge for developers and UX designers: how to efficiently search, explore, access, understand, manage, update,  and apply the visual content? Having just a huge bunch of icons files may not necessarily help you to efficiently and competitively produce and support agile development. Wouldn't it be much more better to have a dedicated platform like [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) that would cope with all sort of the challenges associated with managing, updating, and delivering the visual content in most suitable forms to outperform expectations of even the most demanding developers and UX designers? That is actually what the icons/photos services are all about.
