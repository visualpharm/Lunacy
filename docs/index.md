# Welcome to icons user manual
This document covers pretty much everything you need to know about how to get started and succeed with icons services.

# Why Icons8?

The demand for visual content seems is only getting stronger nowadays. Having just a huge bunch of icons files may not necessarily help one to efficiently and competitively develop and support visually rich applications. Wouldn't it be much better to have a dedicated reliable platform like the [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) that would cope with all sort of the challenges associated with managing icons, keeping them up-to-date, and making them easily accessible in the most suitable forms and various contexts?

# Which license do I need?

Conceptually, the [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) provides two frameworks or in other words two distinct ways of how icons could be accessed and utilized. These two licensing pathways are known as ['Standard'](#standard-framework) and ['Service Integration'](#service-integration-framework) frameworks. Each framework is associated with certain set of tools which are discussed below in detail. 

<!--
One of the most frequently asked questions from our customers is "<b>which license do I need</b>", meaning <b>which framework am I supposed to use</b> to achieve the goals of my project. The rest of this document is purposely dedicated to give you a clear answer for that question and to master the essentials of the frameworks. -->



## Standard Framework

Under the <b>Standard Framework</b> we consider a set of tools that allows our clients to manually search and retreive icons through a GUI. These tools are web and desktop apps. The apps have a very similar functionality with some distinctions which are described in detail below:
 
  <details>
  <summary>
   <strong>Web App</strong>
  </summary>
 
 [Icons web app](https://icons8.com/icons) is availale on any modern web browser and can be accessed via the URL: https://icons8.com/icons. The subscetions below grasp the main features of the web app:
   
  <ul>

   <details>
     <summary>
       <strong> Searching  </strong>
     </summary>
    
   <br>
  Searching is accomplished by entering a search query in the search bar as demonstrated below and pressing enter key / search button. The most relevant icons set shows up. While entering search queries, you may quickly vary icons styles, by selecting a style from the drop down menu. You have an option to view plain icons only as well as icons with titles just by toggling an approprite switch button on the top right of the screen:
  <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/search_with_query_3.png'>
  
  <br>
  <br>
  
  Alternatively searching could be accomplished by browsing through categorized sets of icons listed on the left pane of the app and at the same time by applying various styles as it is shown below. Note that sets of icons available <b>for free in SVG are highlighted</b> with <b>FREE SVG</b> label:
 
   <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/search_by_categories_and_Styles.png'>
   </p>
 
 
  <br>
  While browsing icons within the categorized sets you may quickly try out various styles by selecting a style from the drop down menu: 
  <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/quick_change_of_styles.png'>
 </p>
 
 
  <br>
 Editor tool comes up whenever an icon is clicked: 
  <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/editor_tool_comes_up.png'>
 </p>
 
 Icons editing tools and other tools for manipulation with icons are described in the following subsections.

    <details>
     <summary>
       <strong> Editing/Formating </strong>
     </summary>
  
   <br>
   Editing and formatting tools show up whenever an icon from the list is clicked (see previous subsection on how to retrieve a list of icons you need):
  <p align="center">
   <img width="80%" src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/editor_main_1.png'>
 </p>
 
  <br>
 A group of styles options applicable to the selected icon provide you with ability to quickly change the style of the icon you've just selected just by clicking on the style of your choice.
 <p align="center">
   <img width="80%" src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/editor_main_1_style.png'>
 </p>
  
  <br>
  The editing tools are located on the most left pane of the editor and include the following tools:
  
  - Recolor
  - Overlay
  - Text
  - No efects
  - Stroke
  - Padding
  - Background
  - Circle
  - Square
  
  <br>
 The recolor tool aims to change the most prominent features of an icon. You may use various types of color selection tools to craft the desired look:
 <p align="center">
   <img  src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/recolor_edit.png'>
 </p>
  
  <br>
  Overlay tool provides you with functionality to add an averlay from a list and specify its color:
   <p align="center">
   <img  src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/overlay_edit.png'>
 </p>
 
  <br>
 Text editing is another awesome tool that let you text over your icon and change its size, style and color:
 <p align="center">
   <img   src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/text_tool_edit_1.png'>
 </p>
 Recolor, overlay and text are the effects applied to the icon with the use of toggle button. You may combine the effects by setting the appropriate buttons. The rest of the effects (stroke, padding, background, circle, square) are applied with the use of the radio button. You may apply one of the effect at a time or select the <b>"No Effects"</b> state when neither of the effects mentioned are applied.
 
 <br>
 The stroke effect enhances the prominent features of the icon with the specified size/weight. You may change the color of the stroke either.
 <p align="center">
   <img   src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/stroke_effect_edit.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br>
 Padding effect is used to generate space around an icon inside of outer borders:
 <p align="center">
   <img   src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/padding_effect_edit.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br>
 Background effect adds a background to the icon with the functionality to specify custom color.
 <p align="center">
   <img  src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/background_effect_edit.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br>
 Circle effect has various parameters which make this feature to be a very flexible tool. You may specify stroke, icon and circle sizes. 
 <p align="center">
   <img  src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/circle_effect_edit_with_circle.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br>
 Also by setting up the <b>fill togle</b> to <b>ON</b> state you make the circle to be filled up with specific color that you may choose.
 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/circle_effect_edit_with_fill.png'>
 </p>
 
<br>
 Square effect has similar feature set to the circular effect. In addition square effect has an extra parameter called <b>corner radius</b> that specifies the rounding of the square corners.
 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/square_effect_edit.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br>
 Same as with circle, the square effect has functionality to fill its interior:

       <strong> Collections </strong>
     </summary>
     
  <br>
Collections is the best way to orgonize the icons you like into certain groups for further applications. You may create multiple collections with the 1000 icons limit per collection. Icons can be added into a collection just by dragging and dropping it or just by pressing on a special label in the upper right corner of the outer space surrounding each icon when mouse cursor is over the icon. This is demonstrated on the screenshot below. Notice that red labels indicate that current icon is already added into your collection. 
  
 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/add_icons_to_collection.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br>
You may drag and drop an <b>svg</b> icon from web app or from your local file system right into the collection. 
 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/collections_drag_and_drop.png'>
 </p>
 
  <br>
In addidtion to drag and drop feature you may add new icons to collection by pressing <b>add sign</b> within your collection. This will launch file manager which will guide you through the procedure of selecting an svg file from your local file system and adding it to the collection: 
 
  <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/Collection_FileManager_2.png'>
 </p>
 
  <br>
 To delete an icon from collection just hover the mouse cursor over the icon and click on the trash sign that will come up. A dialog will further ask you to confirm and proceed with the deletion. 
 
 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/delete_item_from_collection.png'>
 </p>
 
  <br>
You may delete the entire collection just by hovering the mouse courser over the collection in the list of collections and ckciking on the trash can icon:

 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/delete_entire_collection_with_trash_can.png'>
 </p>

  <br>
Another way to delete the entire collection or change its title is to click on the more options icon while you are within a given collection. A menu with two options will show up: <b>edit title</b> of the collection and <b>delete</b> the entire collection:

   <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/edit_title_or_delete_entire_collection.png'>

       <strong> Downloading </strong>
     </summary>
     
   <br>
   Icon downloading feature is available from the main icon editor pane which in turn come up whenever an icon is clicked. When the download button is clicked the following screen shows up:
   
 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/download_multiple_edit_2.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br>
 Paying customers are elegible to download icons in png, svg, eps and pdf file formats in any size up to 2048 pixels. Free customers are allowed to download icons in PNG up to 100x100px.

The icon download pane displays a pixel perfect size for the selected icon. You can multiply this platform specific size by various factors like 1x, 2x, 3x etc. to get <b>sharpy</b> .png icons in various sizes. You may choose one of the predefined sizes or specify your custom size.

There is an option to download selected icon in multiple sizes at once as a zip file. To achieve this you have to select the desired sizes with <b>ctrl</b> or <b>cmd</b> key pressed and click on the <b>download</b> button.
  
  <p align="center">

All other services provided absolutely for free without any hidden costs. Of cause, there could be some requests from our clients for custom art/photo processing work, but in general [these](https://icons8.com/paid-license-99/#/) are the only two services that in principle could be payable.

 This section aims to explain in detail various aspects of licensing and pricing for icons/photos services. While the strict [license agreement](https://icons8.com/download/Icons8_License.pdf) mainly focuses on the legitimacy of various types of usage, this chapter helps our clients to quickly grasp the main pricing features and wisely select the best possible usage option.

## Service Integration Framework
In a short, service integration gives you an ability to access icons programmatically, from within your apps, on the fly in real-time. In particular end-users of your products could generate their own projects, build their own visual content from within your apps tied to our service. The framework consist of <b>search engine</b> that allows to programmatically search for icons metadata and icons <b>retrieval service</b> which utilizes that metadata to actually retrieve icons in various formats, styles, colours, sizes etc. Click on the collapsable items below to read more about each of the topics:

   <strong>Search Engine</strong>
  </summary>
  
  
 <!--## Overview-->
 
 
   
Requests to the search engine are constructed with the use of a set of parameters concatenated one after another in a row in the order that can be changed on your own. These paramateres are:

   <details>
     <summary>
       <strong> API key / Token </strong>
     </summary>
 
 
 Personal <b>API key</b> or <b>token</b> is a short code in text format that basically grants you permissions to send requests to both searching and retrieval engines. After we receive a payment from a client we issue an API key. You may proceed with the payment on [this page](https://icons8.recurly.com/subscribe/api_access)

Notice that you can filter results with style/platform and then group the results with the use of categories. Basically when you supply a search query to our <b>Search Engine of Version 4.0</b> you get back a json file which contains all the metadata of the most relevant icons associated with that query. Then you may use this category info contained in the metadata to actually group the results according to the categories. Pay attention that the <b>Search Engine</b> will not return the categories which have less than 10 icons.

      <strong> How to retrieve an icon on PAID basis? </strong>
    </summary>
     
     
The canonical format for retrieving icons in PAID license format is as follows: http://img.icons8.com/[platform]/[size]/[commonName].[format]?token=e5b4w4e6a788431f805c1fkh1e16d  where commonName, platform, token - are mandatory, whereas size - is optional. Lets illustate the procedure on the following example. Assume we call v4 search engine with 'house' searching phrase and receive a JSON respnse as follows: 
    
    
<img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/JSON_RETRIEVE.png'>


For the "house" search query we have response meta info with value "ultroviolet" for platform parameter, and "Link-company-child" for commonName parameter. Thats all we need to get the icon in the svg/eps/pdf/png formats. Here are the complete request strings: 

- 'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child.svg?token=YOURTOKEN' 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child.eps?token=YOURTOKEN' 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child.png?token=YOURTOKEN' 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child.pdf?token=YOURTOKEN' 

Note that the 'name' parameter is not used at all in the constraction of url for retrieving the icon.
<!--
'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child/House.svg?token=we95b4o4ea7t8e41f707bc7dr0a01ef6d'

   <strong>  How do I apply styles? </strong>
 </summary>

On our website, there is a list of icons styles on the left pane of the icons page. The list contains more than 20 various styles to outperform expectations of even the most demanding end-users of your apps. Below is the list of the most popular styles:

|monochrome|coloured|
|----------|--------|
|iOS: http://img.icons8.com/ios/car|Color: http://img.icons8.com/color/car|
|Windows: http://img.icons8.com/windows/car|Office: http://img.icons8.com/office/car|
|Material: http://img.icons8.com/material/car|Dusk: http://img.icons8.com/dusk/car|

[Omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) let you apply a new style as easy as just inserting a style code within an icon’s link.

   <strong> Recolouring monochrome icons made easy </strong>
 </summary>
  
To change the color of an icon with [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service you simply insert an appropriate color code within an icon’s link as it is demonstrated below:
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/ios/FF0000/car'> `http://img.icons8.com/ios/FF0000/car`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/ios/00FF00/car'> `http://img.icons8.com/ios/00FF00/car`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/ios/0000FF/car'> `http://img.icons8.com/ios/0000FF/car`

   <strong> How can I resize an icon? </strong>
 </summary>
   
  To modify an icon’s size the same logic is applied as before. It’s just enough to insert an icon’s size within its link:
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/30px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/30px/car' />
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/40px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/40px/car' />
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/50px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/50px/car' /> 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/60px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/60px/car' /> 

For your convenience, the size of an icon can be written in two different formats: `100x100` or `100px`, depending on what you prefer the most.

   <strong> How can all sorts of artefacts be minimised when using pixel perfect? </strong>
 </summary>
  
Each icon style is drawn for a specific pixel grid. Look at these few examples of various pixel grids: 
* iOS: `50x50`
* Metro: `26x26`
* Windows: `32x32`
* Material: `24x24`
* Color: `48x48`
* Office: `16x16`, `30x30`, `40x40`, `80x80`

In order to avoid all sorts of artefacts (blurring edges, washed out colours etc.) associated with changing an icon’s size, we strongly recommend you to choose multiples of original icon's size. For example for iOS style the multiples would be: `50x50`, `100x100`, `150x150` etc.
You can set an icon’s size either by specifying the size in pixels `100x100` / `100px` or with the use of factors: `2x` or `x2` (the number can vary).
For example:
- 'https://img.icons8.com/color/1x/brazilian-carnival.png' <img src='https://img.icons8.com/color/1x/brazilian-carnival.png'/>
- 'https://img.icons8.com/color/2x/brazilian-carnival.png' <img src='https://img.icons8.com/color/2x/brazilian-carnival.png' />

   <strong> What is the maximum size of an icon that your service can provide? </strong>
 </summary>
  
The restriction applied to free png icons is 550px. Please read more in [API license](https://icons8.com/paid-license-99/#/).

   <strong> What should I do if I can not find an icon that I need? </strong>
 </summary>
  
You may send us a [request](https://icons8.com/request-icon/) to draw any icon you actually  need. It’s completely free. We try to do our the best to make our service comprehensive. However we do prioritise the requests which have the highest demand. You even may ask your friends, relatives and any community members to vote for your requested icon in order put your request on the very top of the queue.

   <strong> Can an icon used in my app change over time? </strong>
 </summary>
  
In short, it’s very unlikely but possible. The most updated version of an icon is accessible by a given icon’s link.
E.G. currently for the following link **`https://img.icons8.com/water-molecule`** we keep showing an icon with illustration of a water drop or an abstract molecule. However if we begin to receive more and more requests to change the icon’s appearance to say a water molecule like this H<sub>2</sub>O, then most probably we will alternate its look somehow to represent the structure of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen bonded together. 

In case if you are planning to use an icon longterm, the best solution would be to use the canonical full path to the icon (.png), which can be formed [here](https://icons8.com/).

   <strong> Can I use an icon with .png extension? </strong>
 </summary>
  
Yes you can use icons with .png extension in [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service, however you would need to know the exact name of a .png icon. The .png names could differ from the names provided by the service. In order to find the desired .png icon name and create an appropriate query for it, you may use searching engine UI available on our website [here](https://icons8.com/icon/new-icons/all).

   <strong>How to use responsive size for style? </strong>
 </summary>
  
It’s quite simple. Just add a parameter `office` to your request. For example:
 - <img src='http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=16'> `http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=16`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=30'> `http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=30`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=40'> `http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=40`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=80'> `http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=80`

The starter icons service integration plan is $100/month - it includes up to 100 000 requests to retrieval engine (actual, non cached icons downloads) per month. Every additional 100 000 requests add $100 more to the monthly plan. You certainly may cache retrieval requests on your side and pay only for actual downloads/retrievals from our engine. Requests to search engine are unlimited within any servce integration plan - no matter how many retrieval requests you've purchased. Payments for the plans are accepted on this page: https://icons8.recurly.com/subscribe/api_access. After we receive a payment we issue an API key or i.e. token for accessing our searching and retieval engines.

   <strong>Why icon size is not icluded in metadata returned by Search Engine? Why Pixel Perfect?</strong>
 </summary>
  
Notice, the icons that we have are of a vector format and that is why they could be of any size. By this reason we do not include the icon's size in metadata of response from search engine. You simply can substitute any value for size parameter in request of a retrieval serivce and receive the corresponding png icon of the size that you requested. For icons retrieval we use [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service. To retrieve an icon you embed your API TOKEN just right into your request http://img.icons8.com/ios/F0AC34/search.svg?token="YOURTOKEN". You may change the order of parameters in your request. Also keep in mind that due to the conversion of svg into png the "pixel perfect" come into play. To eliminate the artefacts of format conversion (from vector to raster) there is an appropriate size for each platform which you can then multiply by various factors 1x, 2x, 3x etc. to get the png size you need.

Unfortunately we do not have such an option at the moment. The best solution would be to purchase a subscription for a month, then download as many icons as you need and eventually cancel the subscription.

After your subscription is canceled you may continue to use your icons in current or future commercial projects. These icons stay yours for good.
