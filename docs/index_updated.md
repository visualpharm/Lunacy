  <p align="center">
   <img   src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/editor_main_2.png'>

A group of styles options is displayed within the editor pane. They are the styles applicable to the selected icon. You may quickly change the style of the icon just by clicking on the style of your choice.
 
 <p align="center">
   <img  src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/editor_main_4_style.png'>

  The editing tools are located on the most left pane of the editor. They are:
  
  - Recolor
  - Overlay
  - Text
  - No efects
  - Stroke
  - Padding
  - Background
  - Circle
  - Square
  
  <br> 
 
  The <b>recolor tool</b> aims to change the most prominent features of an icon. You may use various types of color selection tools to craft the desired look:
  
 <p align="center">
   <img  src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/recolor_edit.png'>
 </p>
  
  <br>

   <img  src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/overlay_edit.png'>
 </p>
 
  <br>
  
 <b>Text editing</b> is another excellent tool. This tool lets you text over your icon and change its size, style, and color:
 
 <p align="center">
   <img   src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/text_tool_edit_1.png'>
 </p>
 
<b>Recolor</b>, <b>overlay</b>, and <b>text</b> are the effects applied to the icon with the use of a toggle button. You may combine the effects by setting the appropriate buttons. The rest of the effects (stroke, padding, background, circle, square) are applied with the use of the radio button. You may apply one of the effects at a time. <b>No effects</b> disables all the effects in the radio group.
 
 <br>
 
The <b> stroke effect</b> enhances the prominent features of the icon with the specified size/weight. You may change the color of the stroke either.
 
 <p align="center">
   <img   src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/stroke_effect_edit.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br>
 
 <b>Padding effect</b> is used to generate space around an icon inside of outer borders:
 
 <p align="center">
   <img   src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/padding_effect_edit.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br> 
 
 <b>Background effect</b> adds a background to the icon. Custom color of the background can be further specified.
 
 <p align="center">
   <img  src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/background_effect_edit.png'>
 </p>

 <b> Circle effect</b>  has various parameters which make this feature to be a very flexible tool. You may specify stroke, icon and circle sizes. 
 
 <p align="center">
   <img  src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/circle_effect_edit_with_circle.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br>

 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/circle_effect_edit_with_fill.png'>

 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/square_effect_edit.png'>

       <strong> Collections </strong>
     </summary>
     
  <br>
  
Collections are the best way to organize the icons you like. Collections help you to group certain icons for further applications. You may create many collections with the 1000 icons limit per collection. An icon can be added to a collection by dragging and dropping it. Another way to add an icon to a collection is by pressing on a special label. This label is located in the upper right corner of the outer space surrounding each icon. The label becomes visible when the mouse cursor is hovering the icon.  Note that the red label states that the current icon is already added into your collection.
  
 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/add_icons_to_collection.png'>
 </p>
 
 <br>

You may drag and drop an <b>SVG</b> icon from the web app or your local file system right into your collection. Please note that only files in SVG format can be added to your collection. 

 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/collections_drag_and_drop.png'>
 </p>
 
  <br>
  
In addition to drag and drop feature, there are two more option exist to add a new icon to your collection. The first one is to click on <b>"add new"</b> button within your collection. This will launch the file manager. The manager will further guide you to select an SVG file from your local file system and add it to your collection:
 
  <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/Collection_FileManager_2.png'>
 </p>
 
  <br>
  
  The last option to collect an icon is to click on the <b>"Collect"</b> button right in the icon editor:
    <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/editor_main_start_collect.png'>
 </p> 
 
  <br>
  
 To delete an icon from a collection, hover the mouse cursor over the icon.  Click on the <b>"trash can"</b> button that will come up. A dialog will further guide you to confirm and proceed with the deletion:
 
 
 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/delete_item_from_collection.png'>
 </p>
 
  <br>
  
To delete the entire collection, hover the mouse cursor over the collection in the list of collections. Click on the <b>"trash can"</b> button:

 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/delete_entire_collection_with_trash_can.png'>
 </p>

  <br>

Another way to delete the entire collection or to change its title is to click on the <b>"more options"</b> button while you are within a given collection. A menu with two options will show up. The options are: <b>"edit title"</b> of the collection and <b>"delete"</b> the entire collection.

   <strong>Free VS Paid </strong>
 </summary>
  
[Omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service provides free and paid options. Yes, you can search and retrieve icons with omg-img for free. The <b>free</b> option works great for small and simple projects. The <b>paid</b> option lets you craft cutting-edge apps. You may use exactly the same paid token to access both searching and retrieval engines. 
  
Lots of the [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) features are available to our clients for free. Premium options are available only to paying clients. The major difference is that <b>paid license</b> provides extra features which are:

- Access to generate PNG icons larger than 550 px
- Access to vector-format icons (SVG, EPS, PDF). Popular SVG icons are available for <b>free</b>.
- Access to more ['advanced search engine'](#service-integration-framework)

   <strong> How to Retrieve an Icon on a PAID Basis? </strong>
 </summary>
  
The format for retrieving icons via paid requests is as follows: 

- http://img.icons8.com/[platform]/[size]/[commonName].[format]?token=YOURTOKEN

<br>

In the above request, parameters commonName, platform, token - are mandatory. Size - is optional. Assume we call v4 search engine with 'house' searching phrase and receive a JSON response as follows:
    
 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/JSON_RETRIEVE_1.png'>
 </p>

Take a look onto parameters in the JSON. Platform parameter attains the value "ultroviolet". The commonName attains the value "Link-company-child". That's all we need to get the icon in the SVG / EPS / PDF / PNG formats by sending the following requests to the [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service:

 <p align="center">

- 'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child.svg?token=YOURTOKEN' 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child.eps?token=YOURTOKEN' 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child.png?token=YOURTOKEN' 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child.pdf?token=YOURTOKEN' 

 </p>

Note that the 'name' parameter is not used at all in building a retrieving URL for the icon.

   <strong> How to Recolor Monochrome Icons? </strong>
 </summary>
  
To change the color of an icon it's enough to insert an appropriate color code within an icon link:
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/ios/FF0000/car'> `http://img.icons8.com/ios/FF0000/car`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/ios/00FF00/car'> `http://img.icons8.com/ios/00FF00/car`

   <strong> How Can I Resize an Icon? </strong>
 </summary>
   
  To change icon size, it’s just enough to embed an icon size within its link:
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/30px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/30px/car' />
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/40px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/40px/car' />
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/50px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/50px/car' /> 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/60px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/60px/car' /> 

Icon's size can be written in two different formats: `100x100` or `100px`.

   <strong> How to Retrieve Sharp Pixel Perfect Icons? </strong>
 </summary>
  
Each icon style is drawn for a specific pixel grid. Look at these few examples of various pixel grids: 
* iOS: `50x50`
* Metro: `26x26`
* Windows: `32x32`
* Material: `24x24`
* Color: `48x48`
* Office: `16x16`, `30x30`, `40x40`, `80x80`

We recommend you to use multiples of original icon size. This will help to avoid all sorts of artifacts (blurring edges, washed out, etc.) associated with changing an icon size. For example, for the iOS style, the multiples would be 50x50, 100x100, 150x150 and so forth. You can set an icon size either by specifying the size in pixels 100x100 / 100px or with the use of factors: 2x or x2 (the number can vary):

- 'https://img.icons8.com/color/1x/brazilian-carnival.png' <img src='https://img.icons8.com/color/1x/brazilian-carnival.png'/>
- 'https://img.icons8.com/color/2x/brazilian-carnival.png' <img src='https://img.icons8.com/color/2x/brazilian-carnival.png' />

We try to do our the best to make our service comprehensive. However, we do prioritize the requests which have the highest demand. Be creative, ask your friends, relatives, and any community members to vote for your requested icon to put your request higher on the queue.

   <strong> Can an Icon Used in my App Change Over Time? </strong>
 </summary>
  
In short, it’s very unlikely, but it's possible. The most updated version of an icon is accessible by a given icon’s link. Let take a look at the following example. Imaging we have a link **`https://img.icons8.com/water-molecule`**. For this URL we keep showing an icon with an illustration of a water drop or an abstract molecule. But what happens if we begin to receive more and more requests to change the icon’s appearance to say a water molecule like this H<sub>2</sub>O. Most probably we will alternate its look somehow to represent the structure of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen bonded together. 

In case <b>if you are planning to use an icon longterm</b>, the best solution would be to use the full canonical path to the icon. For that, type in a query in the app and click on the search icon to get a list of the most relevant icons. 
 <p align="center">
  <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/search_with_query_3.png'>
</p> 

<br>
Then click on the icon you'd like to use. When the editor shows up click on the "HTML" button:
  <p align="center">
   <img   src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/editor_main_2.png'>
 </p>

 Copy the full path to the icon and paste it in your own app:

Paid option means you have to buy an access token. The token is a short string code. You embed the token into your requests for searching and retrieval engines. The same token is used to access both engines. The starter API license is $100/month. It includes up to 100K requests to retrieval engine per month. The requests are the actual, non-cached icons downloads.  Every extra 100K requests add $100 more to the monthly plan. You may cache retrieval requests on your side and pay only for actual downloads from our engine. Requests to search engine have no limit within any API plan. No matter how many retrieval requests you've purchased. You may pay for API license on [this page](https://icons8.recurly.com/subscribe/api_access). After we receive payment, we issue an API token for accessing our engines.

   <strong> Can I download many icons at once? </strong>
 </summary>
  
Yes, you can use collections for that.

Collections provide you the functionality to gather a set of icons. For example, you can create:

- a collection of icons in a specific size or color (available for all users)
- a collection for creating a font or SVG set (for paid users)

<br>
   In order to download a collection you have to select the collection in the list of collections and click on download button.  From the download screen you have several output options for your collection. These output options are:
 
- PNG - download collection as a set of <b>png</b> icons
- FONT - generate <b>font</b> from the collection and download it
- SVG - download <b>svg sprite</b> or zip with <b>individual svg's</b>
- EPS - download collection icons in <b>eps</b> format
- PDF - download collection icons in <b>pdf</b> format

Collections is the best way to orgonize the icons you like into certain groups for further applications. You may create multiple collections with the 1000 icons limit per collection. Icons can be added into a collection just by dragging and dropping it or just by pressing on a special label in the upper right corner of the outer space surrounding each icon when mouse cursor is over the icon. This is demonstrated on the screenshot below. Notice that red labels indicate that current icon is already added into your collection.

      <strong>How can I purchase Service Integration API Key? What is included?</strong>
    </summary>
    
The starter icons service integration plan is $100/month - it includes up to 100 000 requests to retrieval engine (actual, non cached icons downloads) per month. Every additional 100 000 requests add $100 more to the monthly plan. You certainly may cache retrieval requests on your side and pay only for actual downloads/retrievals from our engine. Requests to search engine are unlimited within any servce integration plan - no matter how many retrieval requests you've purchased. Payments for the plans are accepted on this page: https://icons8.recurly.com/subscribe/api_access. After we receive a payment we issue an API key or i.e. token for accessing our searching and retieval engines.

   <strong>Why icon size is not icluded in metadata returned by Search Engine? Why Pixel Perfect?</strong>
 </summary>
  
Notice, the icons that we have are of a vector format and that is why they could be of any size. By this reason we do not include the icon's size in metadata of response from search engine. You simply can substitute any value for size parameter in request of a retrieval serivce and receive the corresponding png icon of the size that you requested. For icons retrieval we use [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service. To retrieve an icon you embed your API TOKEN just right into your request http://img.icons8.com/ios/F0AC34/search.svg?token="YOURTOKEN". You may change the order of parameters in your request. Also keep in mind that due to the conversion of svg into png the "pixel perfect" come into play. To eliminate the artefacts of format conversion (from vector to raster) there is an appropriate size for each platform which you can then multiply by various factors 1x, 2x, 3x etc. to get the png size you need.

      <strong> How to retrieve an icon on PAID basis? </strong>
    </summary>
     
     
The canonical format for retrieving icons via paid requests is as following: 

- http://img.icons8.com/[platform]/[size]/[commonName].[format]?token=YOURTOKEN

<br>

In the above request, parameters commonName, platform, token - are mandatory, whereas size - is optional. Assume we call v4 search engine with 'house' searching phrase and receive a JSON response as following: 
    
 <p align="center">
   <img src='https://github.com/visualpharm/icons-docs/blob/master/docs/Images/Icons/JSON_RETRIEVE_1.png'>
 </p>

In the JSON response we can see that for one of the entries platform parameter attains the value "ultroviolet" and the commonName attains the value "Link-company-child". Thats all we need to get the icon in the svg/eps/pdf/png formats by sending the following requests to the [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service:

 <p align="center">

- 'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child.svg?token=YOURTOKEN' 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child.eps?token=YOURTOKEN' 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child.png?token=YOURTOKEN' 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/ultraviolet/link-company-child.pdf?token=YOURTOKEN' 

 </p>

Note that the 'name' parameter is not used at all in the constraction of url for retrieving the icon.

   <strong> How to retrieve sharp pixel perfect icons? </strong>
 </summary>
  
Each icon style is drawn for a specific pixel grid. Look at these few examples of various pixel grids: 
* iOS: `50x50`
* Metro: `26x26`
* Windows: `32x32`
* Material: `24x24`
* Color: `48x48`
* Office: `16x16`, `30x30`, `40x40`, `80x80`

In order to avoid all sorts of artefacts (blurring edges, washed out colours etc.) associated with changing an icon size, we strongly recommend you to choose multiples of original icon size. For example for iOS style the multiples would be: `50x50`, `100x100`, `150x150` etc.
You can set an icon size either by specifying the size in pixels `100x100` / `100px` or with the use of factors: `2x` or `x2` (the number can vary).
For example:
- 'https://img.icons8.com/color/1x/brazilian-carnival.png' <img src='https://img.icons8.com/color/1x/brazilian-carnival.png'/>
- 'https://img.icons8.com/color/2x/brazilian-carnival.png' <img src='https://img.icons8.com/color/2x/brazilian-carnival.png' />

   <strong> Can an icon used in my app change over time? </strong>
 </summary>
  
In short, it’s very unlikely, but it's possible. The most updated version of an icon is accessible by a given icon’s link.
In other words, currently for the following link **`https://img.icons8.com/water-molecule`** we keep showing an icon with illustration of a water drop or an abstract molecule. However if we begin to receive more and more requests to change the icon’s appearance to say a water molecule like this H<sub>2</sub>O, then most probably we will alternate its look somehow to represent the structure of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen bonded together. 

In case <b>if you are planning to use an icon longterm</b>, the best solution would be to use the canonical full path to the icon. For that, just type-in a query in the app and click on search icon to get a list of the most relevant icons.

It’s quite simple. Just add a parameter `office` to your request. For example:
 - <img src='http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=16'> `http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=16`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=30'> `http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=30`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=40'> `http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=40`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=80'> `http://img.icons8.com/office/50px/car.png?office=80`
