# Licensing model
This section aims to explain in detail various aspects of licensing and pricing for icons/photos services. While the strict [license agreement](https://icons8.com/download/Icons8_License.pdf) mainly focuses on the legitimacy of various types of usage, this chapter helps our clients to quickly grasp the main pricing features and wisely select the best possible usage option.

There are two possibilities for our clients to use [Icons8](https://icons8.com/) services: on a free basis and on a payable basis. Please note that we do provide lots fruitful things to use for free. Actually, among all the icons/photos services there are only two services that potentially could be payable: [regular icon license](https://icons8.com/paid-license-99/#/) and [API integrations license](https://icons8.com/paid-license-99/#/). All other services provided absolutely for free without any hidden costs. Of cause, there could be some requests from our clients for custom art/photo processing work, but in general [these](https://icons8.com/paid-license-99/#/) are the only two services that in principle could be payable.  For information regarding the free of charge usage please read the ['Free of charge licensing'](#free-of-charge-licensing) section below. Payable option of cause have the most ambitious capabilities. All the shades of licensing associated with paid licenses are described in ['Paid licensing'](#paid-licensing) section. 
## Free of charge licensing

You are welcome to use them for free for personal or commercial use however it will require from you to reference us somewhere in an appropriate (publicly accessible) place of your product.
