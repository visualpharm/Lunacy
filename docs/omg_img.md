[Omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) let you apply a new style as easy as just inserting a style code within an icon’s link.

**4. Recolouring monochrome icons made easy**
To change the color of an icon with [omg-img](http://img.icons8.com/) service you simply insert an appropriate color code within an icon’s link as it is demonstrated below:
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/ios/FF0000/car'> `http://img.icons8.com/ios/FF0000/car`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/ios/00FF00/car'> `http://img.icons8.com/ios/00FF00/car`
- <img src='http://img.icons8.com/ios/0000FF/car'> `http://img.icons8.com/ios/0000FF/car`

**5. How can I resize an icon?**
To modify an icon’s size the same logic is applied as before. It’s just enough to insert an icon’s size within its link:
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/30px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/30px/car' />
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/40px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/40px/car' />
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/50px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/50px/car' /> 
- 'http://img.icons8.com/color/60px/car' <img src='http://img.icons8.com/color/60px/car' /> 

For your convenience, the size of an icon can be written in two different formats: `100x100` or `100px`, depending on what you prefer the most.

**6. How can all sorts of artefacts be minimised when using pixel perfect?**
Each icon style is drawn for a specific pixel grid. Look at these few examples of various pixel grids: 
* iOS: `50x50`
* Metro: `26x26`
* Windows: `32x32`
* Material: `24x24`
* Color: `48x48`
* Office: `16x16`, `30x30`, `40x40`, `80x80`

In order to avoid all sorts of artefacts (blurring edges, washed out colours etc.) associated with changing an icon’s size, we strongly recommend you to choose multiples of original icon's size. For example for iOS style the multiples would be: `50x50`, `100x100`, `150x150` etc.
You can set an icon’s size either by specifying the size in pixels `100x100` / `100px` or with the use of factors: `2x` or `x2` (the number can vary).
For example:
- 'https://img.icons8.com/color/1x/brazilian-carnival.png' <img src='https://img.icons8.com/color/1x/brazilian-carnival.png'/>
- 'https://img.icons8.com/color/2x/brazilian-carnival.png' <img src='https://img.icons8.com/color/2x/brazilian-carnival.png' />

**9. What should I do if I can not find an icon that I need?**
You may send us a [request](https://icons8.com/request-icon/) to draw any icon you actually  need. It’s completely free. We try to do our the best to make our service comprehensive. However we do prioritise the requests which have the highest demand. You even may ask your friends, relatives and any community members to vote for your requested icon in order put your request on the very top of the queue. 

**10. Can an icon used in my app change over time?**
In short, it’s very unlikely but possible. The most updated version of an icon is accessible by a given icon’s link.
E.G. currently for the following link **`https://img.icons8.com/water-molecule`** we keep showing an icon with illustration of a water drop or an abstract molecule. However if we begin to receive more and more requests to change the icon’s appearance to say a water molecule like this H<sub>2</sub>O, then most probably we will alternate its look somehow to represent the structure of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen bonded together. 

In case if you are planning to use an icon longterm, the best solution would be to use the canonical full path to the icon (.png), which can be formed [here](https://icons8.com/).
